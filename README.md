# ENTR-451 CSS Practice

- Wireframe (using paper or another tool) a marketing page for something you care about â€“ could be a club/organization you're involved in at Kellogg, a business/startup idea, or just something fun (think a sports team or other fan page)
- In the _public/index.html_ file, build your wireframe using HTML + Bootstrap
  - for example, see [entr451.github.io](https://entr451.github.io) and use the inspector to check out the source code
